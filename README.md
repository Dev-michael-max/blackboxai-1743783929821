1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd neomeet
   ```

2. **Open the `index.html` file** in your preferred web browser or use a local server tool like [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) in Visual Studio Code.

3. **Check all HTML pages**: Open other HTML files like `auth.html`, `dashboard.html`, etc., from the same web directory.
